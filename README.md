# CompressFile

This coding challenge is looking for functionality to compress a file.
The challenge does not care for duplicate entries, and only wants to hold distinct values.
This means the challenge is focused on a lossy algorithm to compress a file.

Will use one of the files offered by the canterbury corpus for compression testing. Specifically "Alice in Wonderland".

TO RUN: compile with an absolute path to text file for compression as an argument, or run and use default text.txt file provided.
